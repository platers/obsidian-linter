# Obsidian Linter

This Obsidian plugin applies consistent styling to your markdown files.
Rules can be added or removed in the settings.

## Usage

To lint the current file, run `Lint the current file` (`Ctrl+Alt+L` by default).

When `Lint on save` is toggled on, the plugin will lint the current file on save.

### Settings

![Settings](https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter/blob/master/docs/settings.png?raw=true)

Add a rule by adding its alias in the settings. The listed rules are applied in order.

Some rules have configurable options, which are set with the format `option=value`.
For example, `yaml-timestamp format="YYYY-MM-DD"`

### Disable rules

```markdown
---
disabled rules: [ capitalize-headings ]
---
```

Add `disabled rules: [ ... ]` to the YAML frontmatter of a file to disable those rules when linting that file. 

Add `disabled rules: [ all ]` to the YAML frontmatter of a file to disable all rules.

2. Run `npm ci` to install dependencies
