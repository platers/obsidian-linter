# Obsidian Linter
![Build](https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

This Obsidian plugin formats and styles your notes with a focus on configurability and extensibility.
Rules can be toggled and configured in the settings.

## Usage

To lint the current file, run `Lint the current file` (`Ctrl+Alt+L` by default).
To lint the all files, run `Lint all files in the vault`.

When `Lint on save` is toggled on, the plugin will lint the current file on manual save (when you press `Ctrl+S`).

### Disable rules

```markdown
---
disabled rules: [ capitalize-headings ]
---
```

Add `disabled rules: [ ... ]` to the YAML frontmatter of a file to disable those rules when linting that file. 

Add `disabled rules: [ all ]` to the YAML frontmatter of a file to disable all rules.

## Rules

Documentation for all rules can be found in the [rules docs](https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter/blob/master/docs/rules.md). The docs are updated before the plugin is released, so may not be completely accurate.

## Development Instructions

Pull requests are welcome, especially for new rules.

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm ci` to install dependencies
3. Add a new rule in `rules.ts`.
    1. Insert a new rule in the corresponding rule type(spacing, headings, etc)
    2. Follow the format of the existing rules
    3. Add tests for edge cases in `test.ts`
    4. You should probably use some helper functions from `utils.ts`, such as `ignoreCodeBlocksAndYAML`.
4. Run `npm run compile` to build, generate documentation, and test the plugin. 
5. Run `npm run lint` to lint the plugin.

Make sure to use Node 15.x or higher.
