These are often user defined or related to the current file or environment to help determine how to execute the rule logic.</p> <p>Here is an example of what rule options look like in use:</p> <pre><code>class YamlKeySortOptions implements Options {\n  priorityKeysAtStartOfYaml?: boolean = true;\n\n  @RuleBuilder.noSettingControl()\n    dateModifiedKey?: string;\n\n  @RuleBuilder.noSettingControl()\n    currentTimeFormatted?: string;\n\n  @RuleBuilder.noSettingControl()\n    yamlTimestampDateModifiedEnabled?: boolean;\n\n  yamlKeyPrioritySortOrder?: string[] = [];\n  yamlSortOrderForOtherKeys?: YamlSortOrderForOtherKeys = 'None';\n}\n</code></pre> <p>There are probably a couple of things you notice that may seem weird. The first thing you may notice is that some rules have <code>@RuleBuilder.noSettingControl()</code> above them and some do not. You may wonder why that is. The reason for this decorator being above some options and not others is that some of these options get their values from the settings for this particular rule and some do not. Using this decorator above options that do not have a setting that is generated by the rule allows us to test that all options for a rule have a corresponding setting and thus get set.</p> <p>Setting noSettingControl settings</p> <p>If you are adding a setting that has no setting control in the rule you are adding, make sure that the value of the setting is being set in rules-runner.ts.</p> <p>The second thing that you may notice is that all of the rule options are optional on the options class (<code>?:</code>). This is done to allow for easier testing in the unit tests and examples since you will only need to set values relevant to the test or example in question.</p> <p>The third thing you may notice is that all of the regular rule options have a default value (<code>= value;</code>). This makes sure that even if no value is provided a default is used. This makes the rule options more reliable and less prone to bugs when reading in the settings file or running unit tests.</p>"},{"location":"contributing/adding-a-rule/#empty-rule-options","title":"Empty Rule Options","text":"<p>There are rules that do not have any options at all.

Each rule setting must correspond to a value in the rule options. Since each rule setting is used to \"build\" the UI component for the corresponding value in the rule options, the rule settings are created via the use of the option builder functions. Another function of the rule settings is that they help link settings in the UI with settings in the config file.</p> <p>In the example above we see the following settings:</p> <pre><code>get optionBuilders(): OptionBuilderBase&lt;YamlKeySortOptions&gt;[] {\n  return [\n    new TextAreaOptionBuilder({\n      OptionsClass: YamlKeySortOptions,\n      nameKey: 'rules.yaml-key-sort.yaml-key-priority-sort-order.name',\n      descriptionKey: 'rules.yaml-key-sort.yaml-key-priority-sort-order.description',\n      optionsKey: 'yamlKeyPrioritySortOrder',\n    }),\n    new BooleanOptionBuilder({\n      OptionsClass: YamlKeySortOptions,\n      nameKey: 'rules.yaml-key-sort.priority-keys-at-start-of-yaml.name',\n      descriptionKey: 'rules.yaml-key-sort.priority-keys-at-start-of-yaml.description',\n      optionsKey: 'priorityKeysAtStartOfYaml',\n    }),\n    new DropdownOptionBuilder&lt;YamlKeySortOptions, YamlSortOrderForOtherKeys&gt;({\n      OptionsClass: YamlKeySortOptions,\n      nameKey: 'rules.yaml-key-sort.yaml-sort-order-for-other-keys.name',\n      descriptionKey: 'rules.yaml-key-sort.yaml-sort-order-for-other-keys.description',\n      optionsKey: 'yamlSortOrderForOtherKeys',\n      records: [\n        {\n          value: 'None',\n          description: 'No sorting other than what is in the YAML Key Priority Sort Order text area',\n        },\n        {\n          value: 'Ascending Alphabetical',\n          description: 'Sorts the keys based on key value from a to z',\n        },\n        {\n          value: 'Descending Alphabetical',\n          description: 'Sorts the keys based on key value from z to a',\n        },\n      ],\n    }),\n  ];\n}\n</code></pre> <p>We see in the example above that there are several common properties among the different kinds of settings.</p> Name Description <code>optionsKey</code> The string name of the property that this setting will update when its value changes on the settings page <code>OptionsClass</code> Allows the option builder validate that rule option specified in <code>optionsKey</code> is the correct type for the values that the option builder expects to deal with <code>nameKey</code> The object property representation of the value in en.ts that has the text for the name of the rule setting <code>descriptionKey</code> The object property representation of the value in en.ts that has the text for the description of the rule setting <p>You may notice that the keys for the settings follow the format of <code>rules.rule-alias.setting-name.name</code> or <code>rules.rule-alias.setting-name.description</code>. Following this pattern allows for ease of understanding what each value means.</p> <p>The <code>DropdownOptionBuilder</code> is a little different from other option builders in that it lets a user select an option from a list know as the <code>records</code>. Records have a value and a description. The value is what is stored in the config and is used as part of the identifier for the key of the display text. For example, the text value of <code>None</code> in the UI is determined by pulling back the text value for <code>enums.None</code> in the corresponding language file (<code>en.ts</code> being the source of truth for all keys). The description of a record currently is only used for documentation and rule searching purposes. It is only in English at this time.</p> <p>The <code>DropdownOptionBuilder</code> is also a little special in that it expects not only the option class, but also the type of the record values to expect (an enum or union type). In the example above we see that <code>DropdownOptionBuilder&lt;YamlKeySortOptions, YamlSortOrderForOtherKeys&gt;</code> expects the values of the records to be part of <code>YamlSortOrderForOtherKeys</code> so it can give warnings about improper values being used in the unit tests and the rule setting itself.
